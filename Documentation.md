## Tasks

* Spent three days learning MERN from scratch
* Implemented client side
* Implemented backend side
* Implemented the communication between client and backend

## Difficulties

* Studying MERN from scratch
* Learning JavaScript because I used object-oriented programming language like java and c# more in my previous internship and team projects
* Overcoming lots of bugs due to low familiarity with JavaScript and MERN stack
